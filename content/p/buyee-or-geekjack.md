## Intro

Recently I've been hooked with VTuber from Hololive and Nijisanji.
Usually they sell the official goods through [BOOTH](https://booth.pm/) or [Geek Jack](https://www.geekjack.net/).
Geek Jack ships globally, but BOOTH ship to Japan address only.
So I need another proxy service like [Buyee](https://buyee.jp/) if I were to buy from BOOTH.

I want to compare the experience of buying the goods through Buyee and Geek Jack, so I will keep notes of them here.

## Data

All prices are in JPY. Prices doesn't include customs tax etc. Service fee include things like consolidation and protective packages.
Some goods are pre-ordered, so the total days doesn't count the days where the service are waiting for the goods to be shipped from the seller.

| Goods | Goods Price | Service | Service Fee | Delivery Fee | Date Bought | Received After x Days | Total Days |
| ----- | ----------: | ------- | ----------: | -----------: | :---------: | :-----------: | ----------: |
| Hoshimachi Phone Case + T-Shirt | 8500 | Buyee | 1800 | 3442 | 25-06-2020 | 27 | x |
| Watame Birthday 2020 Full Set | 10000 | Geek Jack | - | 2000 | 11-07-2020 | 102 | x |
| Marin Birthday 2020 Full Set | 10000 | Buyee | 1800 | 3080 | 07-08-2020 | 133 | x |
| Shion 2nd Anniv Full Set | 10000 | Buyee | 1800 | 2810 | 18-08-2020 | 122 | x |

## Services Comparison

- Order status tracking

Both services provide the order status. Buyee displays the order status on the site and sends notification email. 
Geek Jack only show something like "Order Status Succeeded" in the site. Everything else goes to the email.
They'll sent something like "The benefits of [Goods Name] will arrive at our warehouse next week. We will start shipping as soon as possible."

Overall, there's not much difference for the order status udaptes other than the misleading status in the Geek Jack site.

- Buying limited quantity goods

With how Buyee works, when I buy goods through Buyee, I need to wait for someone from Buyee to buy my item

- Delivery courier choices
- Prices
- Payment
- Changing address - support?
